# MTech CSE

The goal of post graduate programs at IIIT-B is to develop professionals of high quality to cater to the needs of industry and academia. Such education will be based on a broad grasp of the fundamental principles of the sciences and scientific methods, a deep understanding of specific area of specialization, an ability to solve new problems, and a capacity to learn continually and interact with multidisciplinary groups. Above all, IIIT-B aims at developing in its students a capacity for free and objective enquiry, courage and integrity, and awareness and sensitivity to the needs and aspirations of society. The postgraduate programs are designed with the above goals in view. They include courses of study, seminars, project work, internships, and research leading to a thesis.

 

M.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering is a two-year (4 semester) programme.  Students in the first semester can choose foundational courses from a given pool covering the areas of algorithms, software systems, and mathematics. As part of the mandatory branch electives students must do courses from the area of TCS (Theoretical Computer Science) and SY (Software Systems). Subsequently, they can choose electives in one of the following areas:

 

Specialization

1. TCS (Theoretical Computer Science).

2. SY (Software Systems).

Minor

1. AIML (Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning).

2. NC (Networking and Communication).

3. VLSI (VLSI Systems).

4. DT (Digital Society).

 

Selection Procedure:  GATE (CS) SCORE

Intake:  120

All students enrolled in the M.Tech programme are residential, full-time students.

During refund of Caution Deposit, besides any library or lab fine if any, following will be deducted from the Caution Deposit amount:-

Alumni Subscription—Rs 5000/-
Convocation Charges -  Rs 2000/-
Hostel painting and maintenance charges - Rs 1800


Every student needs to pay insurance charges of INR 2,000/- per year (subject to revision every year).


Other costs for books and supplies, travel, purchase of a laptop, etc. need to be factored by students themselves depending on their individual circumstances/needs.

# Scholarships

In the past, the Institute has offered about 5 scholarships each year (out of the 150+ students) to meritorious students joining the M.Tech programme (CSE+ECE). The Institute expects to offer a similar number of industry-funded scholarships in the current year as well. The scholarship amount covers almost all student expenses over the duration of their M. Tech programme. The selection for these industry-sponsored scholarships is carried out by the industry representatives along with IIITB faculty coordinators.


In addition to the IIITB scholarships, GATE-qualified students will be eligible for fellowships from AICTE as per AICTE norms (across CSE and ECE).

# Accomodation

Since the M.Tech programme is very demanding, and classes, tutorials and laboratory sessions often extend beyond regular working hours and during the weekends, staying at the hostel accommodation provided by the Institute is mandatory.

The male students admitted to the M.Tech programme will be provided accommodation in an off-campus hostel facility arranged by IIITB. The female students will be provided hostel accommodation on campus itself. The hostel fee rates are applicable uniformly for all the students irrespective of the hostel location.
