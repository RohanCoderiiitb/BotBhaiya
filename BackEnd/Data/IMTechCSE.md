# IMtech ECE

IIIT-B introduced a 5-year Integrated M.Tech. (I.M.Tech.) programme in 2012. The Integrated M.Tech. programme is a 5-year integrated programme intended for students who have completed or are completing Plus Two of schooling (or equivalent). At the end of five years of the programme, successful students get dual degrees of B.Tech. and M.Tech. The students will be taught and supervised by the faculty members with PhD from highly reputed universities of the world and involved in R&D in niche areas of CSE. 

 

I.M.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) is a ten-semester programme where the first eight semesters constitute academic course work. Students from fifth semester onwards register for elective courses. As part of the mandatory branch electives students must do courses from the area of TCS (Theoretical Computer Science) and SSY (Software Systems). During the ninth semester, students are given an option to work on a project or choose course work which will help in pursuing higher studies. In the 10th semester, the student may opt for thesis or internship in a well-recognized organization. Students have obtained fellowships for doing internships in universities abroad through various study-abroad initiatives such as DAAD, MITACS.

 

From 2024, a new curriculum is followed that allows dual specialization for I.M.Tech. (CSE) students. A student needs to complete 20 credits in the respective specialization to become eligible for a specialization. Students of I.M.Tech. (CSE)  can specialize in the following SIX areas:

 

1.         AIML (Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning).
2.         TCS  (Theoretical Computer Science).
3.         SSY (Software Systems).
4.         NC (Networking and Communication).
5.         VLSI (VLSI Systems).
6.         DT (Digital Society).
 

Note: The above list of areas is subject to change and refinements from time to time.

**Qualification Requirements:**
Applicants must have completed 10+2 (or equivalent) with a first-class grade and Mathematics as one of the subjects. Students who are expected to meet this requirement by July 2025 are also eligible to apply. Additionally, a valid JEE Main score from 2025 is required.
