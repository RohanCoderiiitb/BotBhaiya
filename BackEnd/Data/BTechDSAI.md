# Btech CSE

The four-year B.Tech. programme in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (AI&DS) is designed to produce high quality graduates in the emerging areas of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (AI&DS), who are well equipped with skills that are required to solve real world problems. The job opportunities for graduates with AI&DS skills is on the rise, like other two above areas. The students will be taught and supervised by faculty members with a PhD from highly reputed universities of the world and involved in R&D niche areas of Data Science – Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. This program produces a well-prepared and well-motivated workforce to undertake careers in research and industry involving innovation, knowledge creation, engineering, and entrepreneurship. The B. Tech.(AI&DS) programme follows a flexible curriculum that covers the theoretical underpinnings of data science, statistics, artificial intelligence and machine learning. The curriculum gives due importance to the foundational aspects of AI&DS, as well as develops in students the necessary engineering skills for addressing emerging technological challenges. After five semesters of foundational courses, students from sixth semester onwards register for elective courses under the Choice Based Credit Systems (CBCS) as recommended by AICTE and other regulatory bodies. In the 8th semester, the student may opt for a thesis or internship in a well-recognized organization. 
 
Students interested in the core of AI&DS domain are encouraged to specialize in one of the following listed domains by earning an additional 20 credits in that specific domain. Students completing AI&DS specialization (non-minor) with CGPA above or equal to 3.5/4.0 will be graduating with a B. Tech. (Honours) in AI&DS.
 
Specializations:
 
   1. AI&DS Algorithms
   2. AI&DS in Data Domains (e.g. NLP, Vision)
 
Alternatively, the students can earn a minor in a non-AI&DS area by successfully completing an additional 20 credits in the area chosen. The minor could be in one of the following listed areas:
 
   1. VLSI (VLSI Systems)
   2. SY (Software Systems). 
   3. DT (Digital Society).
 
Note: The above lists of areas are subject to change and get refiined from time to time.
