# Btech CSE

The four-year B. Tech. programme in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at IIIT-B is designed to produce high-quality graduates equipped to tackle real-world challenges using advanced computational techniques. The programme nurtures a well-prepared and motivated workforce capable of pursuing careers in research, industry, innovation, knowledge creation, engineering, and entrepreneurship. The students will be taught and supervised by faculty members with a PhD from highly reputed universities of the world and involved in R&D in niche areas of CSE. The curriculum is flexible and comprehensive, covering both the theoretical foundations of computer science and a broad range of essential topics in computer systems. It emphasizes core principles while developing the engineering skills necessary to address emerging technological challenges. From the fifth semester onward, students choose elective courses under the Choice Based Credit System (CBCS), in accordance with AICTE and other regulatory guidelines. As part of their core specialization, students are required to take electives in Theoretical Computer Science (TCS) and Software Systems (SSY). The programme also includes a mandatory internship or thesis to provide practical exposure and research experience.
 
Specializations:
 
The following are the optional specializations available for B.Tech. (CSE).
 
   1. TCS (Theoretical Computer Science).
   2. SSY (Software Systems). 
 
Alternatively, the students can earn a minor in a non-CSE area by successfully completing an additional 20 credits in the area chosen. The minor could be in one of the following listed areas:
 
   1. AIML (Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning)
   2. NC (Networking and Communication).
   3. VLSI (VLSI Systems).
   4. DT (Digital Society).
 
Note:  As technologies are changing, the above lists of areas and courses are subject to change and get refined from time to time.
 
Note that students can complete B. Tech. (CSE) programme without the requirement of earning a specialization or minor with extra credits.
